Vocal\+Eyes will be a device/wearable that will include a camera and a speaker module. The major goal of the Vocal\+Eyes is to help the visually impaired. The visual eyes will recognize an object that the user directs it at (via the camera module) and will output audio information (via the speaker module) about what the object is. (eg\+: in case of text it will readout the text).\hypertarget{index_Working}{}\doxysection{Directories}\label{index_Working}
